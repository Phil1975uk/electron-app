1. For Development (npm run dev)
No recompilation is needed after editing JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files in the electron-app/renderer folder or the main Electron files (main.js, etc.).
Just save your changes and restart the app with:
  npm run dev


Electron will load the latest code every time you start it.
2. For Distribution (Installer/Portable .exe)
If you want to create a new installer or portable .exe (to give to others or run on another computer), you DO need to recompile (rebuild) the app.
Run:
  npm run build-installer


or
  npm run build-portable


This will package all your latest changes into a new .exe in the dist folder.
