  "content": "There is space for up to three children age 7 or younger in the 100% recyclable EPP box produced with zero emissions. And their safety is top priority: the child seats all feature 5-point seat belts, while the side impact protection provides outstanding safety in urban traffic and the central railing doubles as a grab handle. Optional accessories, such as the all-season child cover or tarpaulin, are produced in a resource-efficient manner, and the child seats are made of 100% recycled material. So now you can transport your children worry-free. (Loading surface approved for up to 70 kg. Please observe national regulations for the transport of children on bikes before using.)",
