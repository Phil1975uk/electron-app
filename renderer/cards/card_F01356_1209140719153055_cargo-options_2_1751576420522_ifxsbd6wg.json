Five-point belts ensure maximum safety. Our child seats with continuous headrest are made of 100% recycled material. The front luggage rack offers maximum storage space. When folded down, it lets you transport luggage up to the size of a crate of water, and secure it, thanks to eyelets and other fastening options with additional straps. Alternatively, the luggage rack can also be used as a table for your children with space underneath for their feet. When folded up, it creates a luggage compartment, the rubber straps of which securely fix slimmer objects, like shoulder bags, in place. The 47-litre box supplied fits perfectly onto the luggage rack or into a shopping trolley and, thanks to its food-safe and recyclable PP design, is ideal for your weekly shopping. Alternatively, you can transport larger loads by folding up the seat part of the double child seat. Please observe national regulations for the transport of children on bikes before using.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- Image -->\n<div class=\"feature-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-c8jhcan2jv/images/stencil/original/image-manager/70-24-detail.jpg.695x464-q80-upscale.jpg?t=1713439541\" alt=\"Packster2 70 Double child seat and luggage shelf at the front\"></div>\n</div>",
