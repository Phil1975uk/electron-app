Nothing disrupts your safe and agile riding experience, as the Cargo Bike can handle almost all needs, thanks to its low centre of gravity, its many individual equipment options and refined Control Technology. For greater freedom and flexibility â€“ whatever your plans. (Loading surface approved for up to max. 70 kg.)",
