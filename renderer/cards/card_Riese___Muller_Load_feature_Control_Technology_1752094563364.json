  "description": "Admittedly, not everyone immediately thinks of fun on two wheels when you hear the words “Cargo Bike”. But this changes when you sit on a Load with Control Technology. The optimised chassis and the finely tuned full suspension ensure optimum comfort, safe riding even at higher speeds, excellent road holding and thus top-of-the-range riding dynamics. Vibrations and hard impacts, such as from cobblestones or kerbs, are significantly reduced and you are in control.",
