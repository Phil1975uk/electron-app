  "content": "Regardless of whether you need to transport the weekly shop or other goods – the Multitinker effortlessly carries the load on its rear, thanks to its powerful Bosch Performance Line Cargo motor with 625 Wh battery. The front luggage carrier provides additional space; and we’ve invented the frame bag for smaller items. Sideloaders are available if you need more space – holding max. 20 kg on each side – and there is also an interface for the attachment of a trailer coupling. The Multitinker is as compact as a normal E-Bike and, thanks to its low centre of gravity, is incredibly easy to ride even fully loaded up.",
