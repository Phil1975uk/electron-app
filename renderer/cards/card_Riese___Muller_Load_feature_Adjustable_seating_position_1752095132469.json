  "description": "Thanks to the angle- and height-adjustable stem and the adjustable saddle height, the seat position can be altered to accommodate body sizes of from 1.50 m to 2.00 m, and adapted from sporty to comfortable. The overall geometry of the bike can be perfectly adjusted to the rider in just a few easy steps. This flexibility makes the Load ideal for shared use, for example within a family.",
