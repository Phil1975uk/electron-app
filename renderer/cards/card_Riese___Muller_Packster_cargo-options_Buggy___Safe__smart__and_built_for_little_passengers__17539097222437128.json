  "description": "The Buggy option makes family transport easy and secure. Half-height side walls and a step let kids climb in and out with ease, while the sturdy aluminium frame and polypropylene roof offer extra protection — even in a collision. The water-repellent cover avoids PVC and includes tinted windows, roll-up sides, and a rear panel to shield against wind and rain.\n\nMax load: 70 kg. Please check local laws before transporting children by bike.",
