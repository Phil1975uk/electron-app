<h2>Double child seat</h2>

<h3>Â£187.00</h3>

<p>The double child seat with adjustable sitting and sleeping position holds two children age seven or younger. Five-point belts ensure maximum safety. Our child seats with continuous headrest are made of 100% recycled material. The headrest can be folded down into the box if required. Alternatively, you can transport larger loads by folding up the seat part of the double child seat. Please observe national regulations for the transport of children on bikes before using.</p>
